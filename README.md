# Password generator
Random password generator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### You can check it out [here](salvarez96.github.io/Password-generator/).

---
### Description:
The program creates a random password between 6 and 30 characters long, depending on the user's preference, which includes lower/uppercase letters and numbers. It can also copy the password to the clipboard with the push of a button so the user can paste it wherever he/she decides to.

### Future plans:
- Add the option to include other characters (like +*?Â¿!$... you get the point) to make the password even more difficult.
- Create a little message so the user knows if the password was succesfully copied to the clipboard.
- Add animations to the UI.
- Add some tips about passwords.
